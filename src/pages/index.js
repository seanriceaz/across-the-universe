        In just a few days, we blast off into the unknown. At first, we'll only be miles apart--good enough for simultaneous video links.<br />
        After a short while, we will see a noticeable lag in our conversations as the speed of light becomes more tangible.<br /><br />
        It's mere seconds as we get close to the moon... <br />
        Then minutes as we reach our closest neighboring planets... <br />
        Then it might be hours...
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you stay connected to those you love when youâ€™re dealing with distance like this? When the speed of light isn't fast enough?

        These games can be played on a video call, or through photos, or even audio or text message.
        <br /><br />
        Every game here has a real-world aspect. No videogames or VR headsets needed.
        <br /><br />
        They're perfect for kids to play with grandparents, or distant friends. They're good, clean, free, fun.
